  tutorial_7: `Or, if Period Tracker App thinks your period is over, but it is actually still happening, tap the 'Period Day' shape!`,
  tutorial_8: `And if Period Tracker App predicted you would have your period, but actually you didn't, then tap the 'No Period' shape!`,
  tutorial_9: `Each day, track how you feel and what you did using the Diary cards! Swipe right to get to the next card. This improves Period Tracker App's predictions and helps you learn more about yourself...`,
  tutorial_10: `The first card in your Daily Diary is a summary of your day, showing the date, how far you are in your cycle, and how many stars you've won for that day.`,

  about_content_2: `Period Tracker App is a period tracking app designed for girls and by girls: it's fun and positive because we want to reverse the shyness and bad feelings that periods can sometimes cause! \n`,
  about_content_3: `Organization created Period Tracker App as part of its mission to promote girl‚Äôs education and health, by changing one of the world‚Äôs biggest taboos: menstruation. \n \n`,
  about_content_4: `All women and girls have their periods. It‚Äôs natural. But girls still get shamed for it. They often lack information about what is happening to their bodies at a critical time in their lives when so much is changing. \n \n`,
  about_content_5: `It can be difficult to find trustworthy, quality information online that is relevant. There is so much misinformation out there. All this can make periods stressful, when they don't need to be. Period Tracker App is designed to help girls manage their periods with confidence, because girls should be able to make informed decisions about their bodies and their lives.\n\n`,
  about_content_6: `We spent months talking to more than 400 girls in Mongolia and Indonesia about their periods, their fears, their hopes and their lives, and worked together to co-create Period Tracker App! Of course, we also worked with our education and medical experts to ensure that Period Tracker App reflect Organization‚Äôs ethics and its high health standards and guidelines.  \n \n`,
  about_content_7: `Period Tracker App allows you to add information about your period, body, activities and mood, and based on this, provides predictions about you next period and ovulation cycle. There is a calendar, which acts as a diary and helps with reminders. Period Tracker App gives tips and motivation through games & quizzes too!\n\n`,
  about_content_8: `Period Tracker App is different from other period tracking apps because it is aimed particularly at girls. Period Tracker App is not a business, it is a service for girls that aims to be inclusive and non-judgemental, and maintains the highest privacy and data protection standards.\n \n `,
  about_content_9: `Period Tracker App is developed in an open way so others can learn from the process of creating a digital public health resource. This way, it can be useful to more people and contribute to changing the way our digital information is used for profit rather than for public good.`,
