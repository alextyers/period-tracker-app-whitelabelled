          "The menstrual cycle starts with the first day of your period and ends with the start of your next period. It's called a cycle because it repeats regularly. \n\nDuring the cycle, hormones (chemicals in your body) go up and down, causing other body changes.\n \nAn entire menstrual cycle can last between 21 and 38 days, but for most girls and women, the length often changes from cycle to cycle, and it changes over the years.\n\nEverybody is different, and variations in your cycle are normal. When girls first start to get periods, their menstrual cycle is often not regular. Periods can come one month and not the next, or come only a couple of weeks apart. \n\nIt may take a few years before a girl’s cycle is more regular. Comparing your cycle to others, or what's 'normal' can make you feel there's something wrong, although everything is probably OK. \n\nUsing Period Tracker App to track your period will help you see what is normal for YOU. If you notice something unusual for you personally, then it probably is a good idea to talk to a grown up you trust, and a doctor.",
