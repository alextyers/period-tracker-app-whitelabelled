When girls first start to get periods, their menstrual cycle is often not regular. Periods can come one month and not the next, or come only a couple of weeks apart. \n\nIt may take a few years before a girl’s cycle is more regular. Comparing your cycle to others, or what's 'normal' can make you feel there's something wrong, although everything is probably OK. \n\nUsing Oky to track your period will help you see what is normal for YOU. If you notice something unusual for you personally, then it probably is a good idea to talk to a grown up you trust, and a doctor.",
